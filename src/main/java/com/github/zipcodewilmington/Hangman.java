    //hello my Name is Josue!


    //try to keep your methods small
    //if methods get too big, break them up into smaller pieces with other methods
    //DO GIT COMMITS ALONG THE WAY!!!


        //FOR VERSION 1 OF YOUR GAME
    //start the game
    //make an array of words
    //choose a random word from this array
    //find how many letters are in the random word
    //declare that you get x amount of tries from the amount of letters in step above
    //set up a solution array
    //set up an empty guesses array that the user will guess chars into

    //set a while loop (while number of tries < tries allowed) AND
    //the player has not guessed the word...
    //print current state of player guesses, ask player for a new guess, if char = "-", quit the game,
    //ELSE process the letter
    //if the letter makes the word complete - PLAYER WINS


    //after this while loop - if the word is not guessed - player loses.

    /*
    VERSION 2: add a while (true) conditional wrapped around the whole game code
     that won't start unless they say Y/N to play again
